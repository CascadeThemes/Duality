# Duality 
Obsidian Theme


Its dual light and dark modes cater to the ebb and flow of your creative process, allowing you to shift seamlessly between the luminous inspiration of a divine realm and the raw intensity of a gothic underworld.

## Dark Theme
Plunge into the depths of a dungeon-inspired (Diablo II) dark theme, where fiery orange-red accents and deep gray-blacks conjure the atmosphere of an ancient, candlelit scriptorium. Ideal for crafting intense narratives or exploring the shadows of your imagination, this mode offers stark contrast and a medieval edge. Stark contrasts, fiery accents, and medieval-inspired borders transform your Obsidian vault into a fortress of creativity.

## Light Theme
Bathe your notes in a soft, celestial palette of blues and golds, evoking the tranquility of a divine library. The light theme is perfect for writers seeking clarity and inspiration, with a warm golden accent that feels like sunlight on parchment. Subtle gradients and ethereal hues create a serene environment that encourages focus and flow. Soft gradients, rounded corners, and a golden divine glow in the titlebar and canvas create a workspace that feels like writing in a heavenly scriptorium.
